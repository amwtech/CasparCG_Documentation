# Introduction to CasparCG Graphics System - Documentation
## Background
CasparCG is a broadcast quality graphics system created by Sveriges Television (SVT) initially for internal use. Subsequently they made the graphics system available to others by publishing it under an open source licence.

CasparCG operates as a client-server architecture where the server plays out video and graphics content under the control of one or more clients. SVT have published the code for both the server and a standard client. The communication protocol between the client and server uses a published text message structure known as Advanced Media Control Protocol (AMCP).

## This Repository
This repository provides a user guide to the CasparCG system. It describes the operation of the CasparCG server, the standard client, how playout sequences are created and played. It describes how the server and client are configured to meet a users operational requirement.

A templates sub-folder contains one or more HTML templates for use in CasparCG server.
